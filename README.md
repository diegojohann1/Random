# RandomUserExercise
Create a simple app using the Random User API. * The app should have a Master/Detail flow in which at least 50 profile image thumbnails are shown on a grid on a “home” screen. * When users tap on a thumbnail on the grid, they’re taken into a new screen in which the large image is shown on the top of the screen, and some basic user data is listed below: username, first name, last name, and email address.
